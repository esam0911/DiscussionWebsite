<h1>Doctrinal Discussions</h1>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>This is the official headquarters for the doctrinal discussions group. This website will contain all the links, names, announcements, and general information
you will need to be an active participant in the discussions. This study is meant to be a group study focused on controversial doctrines. The purpose
is to become familiar with a broad range of doctrines, understand the biblical passages related to the doctrines, and be able to take and defend a 
viewpoint concerning each doctrine. Each study will consist of an individual study using a weekly study guide and then a group discussion about each person's
findings. The meetings are currently taking place on Adobe Connect, a dynamic meeting platform. If you do not already have it downloaded on your computer, please
download it now.</p>

<p>Meeting time: Fridays, 10:00am-11:40am EST.
